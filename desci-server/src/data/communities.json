      "description": "Gridcoin is an open-source multi-incentive permissionless blockchain that mints and distributes cryptocurrency to various contribution-based and point-accruing systems. It currently distributes currency according to the relative processing power a network participant directs toward data-driven analysis and scientific discovery across the Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Networked Computing and Folding@Home. The Gridcoin blockchain is secured through the proof-of-stake v2 protocol and utilizes several mechanisms to assure network, data, identity, and economic security. Access to Gridcoin’s computational resources is free for any project with data to process while contributors to the Gridcoin network are incentivized with cryptocurrency minted and distributed by the Gridcoin protocol.\n\nBOINC is an open source platform for volunteer computing that lets individuals use their computers & phones to help science research. It is free to use and already home to 30+ projects over a range of scientific disciplines. Examples include protein structure prediction (Rosetta@home), mapping the Milky Way galaxy (Milkyway@home), and tackling problems in public health and clean energy (World Community Grid).",

      "description": "Supporting VitaDAO's mission to improve healthspan, we endeavour to spotlight the most groundbreaking longevity studies each quarter. Our editorial team utilises a combination of social listening tools, AI, and an expansive network to forge a shortlist of preprint contenders. Our expert panel of Longevist Curators then vote in a quarterly battle royale to establish the cream of the crop.\n\nPreprints have revolutionised scientific publishing by enabling researchers to share their discoveries with the world immediately. However, the sheer volume of preprints being published on a daily basis results in an overwhelming landscape for those eager to keep up with the cutting edge of science.\n\nThis is where The Longevist steps in.\n\nIn addition to curation, The Longevist fosters a space for collaborative discourse, through our peer review platform - The Longevity Decentralised Review - to seamlessly blend expert insights with user-friendly, advanced technology.\n\nWe invite you to join this vibrant community. Dive deep into the latest in longevity science and play a pivotal role in shaping the future narrative of this fascinating field.",

By participating in this competition, authors can earn financial rewards. Emphasizing the importance of open access and collaboration, this fund supports projects that utilize DeSci Nodes to share original scientific research with the world. We aim to empower both established researchers and citizen scientists in their endeavors, fostering an ecosystem where scientific discovery is transparent, reproducible, and accessible to all. By backing initiatives that harness DeSci Nodes for everything from hypothesis registration to data sharing and manuscript publication, we’re not just funding projects; we’re investing in a more open, collaborative, and efficient scientific future.\n\n## Eligibility Requirements\n\nTo qualify for the DeSci Fund, your project must adhere to the following criteria:\n\n- _DeSci Nodes Usage_: Projects must actively utilize DeSci Nodes for sharing research results and artifacts publicly, including a scientific manuscript that was written and submitted by the original authors. Manuscripts can be as long or short as appropriate, but they must be a PDF file containing a title on the first page, author names listed right below the title on a separate line, an abstract, a main text body, and a bibliography section titled “References” or “Bibliography” at the end. These formatting guidelines are required to enable Google Scholar to index your work. Submissions from all fields of science are welcome.\n\n- _Open Science Emphasis_: Projects should follow best open science practices to the best of their ability, including sharing artifacts such as data and code alongside manuscript, conducting research based on pre-registered analysis plans, full transparency about methods used, and making active efforts to enable the reproducibility of the reported results as much as possible. \n\n- _Innovative Research Focus_: Preference is given to projects offering novel, ambitious scientific research or technology.\n\n## Participation\n\nTo participate, create a visual representation of your research called an Artifact. Your Artifact can be any image, video, or gif that captures the spark of inspiration behind your work. Submit your Artifact and project description to [https://vote.artizen.fund/submit](https://vote.artizen.fund/submit). Selected contributions will be highlighted with an open-edition NFT.
